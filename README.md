 <font size= "4"> <div align= "left">
  Classifying program is a .ipynb. This file is accessible with any IDE that can read .ipynb files such as Jupyter Notebook or VS Code. When using an IDE that can read .ipynb files, compiling and execution are done automatically and individually for each code cell.
  To execute our program, carefully read the parameters and return data for our load and split function. Use this to modify the current train, test, and labels sets or create your own.

#### Resources

  The only resource necessary is the Happy Whale data set itself. Unfortunately, we cannot included the data set in this github repository. You may download the data set from Kaggle by following this link to the Happy Whale Kaggle competition page: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/happy-whale-and-dolphin/overview.
