### Classifies Whale and Dolphin species from the Kaggle Competition data set Happy Whale.

#### Compile & Execute
Classifying program is a .ipynb. This file is accessible with any IDE that can read .ipynb files such as Jupyter Notebook or VS Code. When using an IDE that can read .ipynb files, compiling and execution are done automatically and individually for each code cell.
To execute our program, carefully read the parameters and return data for our load and split function. Use this to modify the current train, test, and labels sets or create your own.
!! Before executing, ensure that the working director variable correctly represents the location of the Happy Whale data set in your local machine. !!

#### Resources
The only resource necessary is the Happy Whale data set itself. For easy of access, we have included the data set in this github repository. If you would like to download the data set from Kaggle instead follow this link to the Happy Whale Kaggle competition page: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/happy-whale-and-dolphin/overview.
